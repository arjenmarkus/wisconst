# wisconst - a collection of notes on mathematical subjects


## On the name "wisconst"
I do not pretend that I am an expert in mathematics but over the years I have
picked one or two things, gotten interested in many different mathematical subjects
and I have written a few notes. This project collects these notes without pretending
they are absolutely correct or of any importance at all.

The name "wisconst" comes from the Dutch scientist and science populariser Simon Stevin.
He it was that gave the Dutch language many technical and scientific terms that are
Dutch rather than Greco-Latin. Such as the Dutch word for mathematics: wiskunde or
back in his days, wisconst. He was a great populariser who wrote books in Dutch
instead of Latin to make them more accessible to the general public. And while I
cannot stand in his footsteps or even in his shadow, I chose this name of this
collection to honour him and to come a bit closer.

## The notes ...
The notes are actually a potpourri of subjects. I bring them together in this
repository in the hope that they may amuse people. Some things I found puzzling, like
the geometrical riddle, where I simply lack the technical mathematical skills to see
what is wrong in the reasoning. Other notes explore what algorithm could be used,
like the smallest circle that surrounds an arbitrary set of points.

The PDFs of the notes are found in the "doc" subdirectory. The Latex source files,
programs (mostly for drawing the pictures) and such are contained in the "src"
directory.
